# Webpack 4 from absolute scratch mini series

Writing your own Webpack 4 configuration from absolute scratch is not strictly necessary. You could go online, find a basic Webpack configuration file and fork it/copy it to your project and use that as your starting point.

Whilst using a starter project is good for getting started quickly, it is better to have a more indepth understanding of what is happening, to help with customisations and debugging later.

I have written a full tutorial to accompany this repository, which you can find on my personal blog.
